i am building a timetabling system for university.
I have schools, departments for each school, courses offered in each department, units for each course and the semester for which they are taught, i have semesters, days of the week from monday to friday, i have timeslots. All these are already in the database.

- Lecturers selected the units they will teach for a certain semester, for example semester 2 from First years to fourth years.
- There are rooms which are used for theory lessons and those used for ICT Practical and also those used for Electronics practical.

Given the above story, please break down the problem of generating a timetable into as many tasks as possible. i.e Task 1:....
task 2 .... etc.

Then for each task independently write code to achieve the task objective

. The condition is, a lecturer cannot be allocated 2 or more units on the same day at exactly the same timeslot.

- A room cannot be allocated 2 or more units at the same day at the same timeslot
